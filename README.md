# Network-Vulnerability-Scanner
Final Project - Network Vulnerability Scanner
## Project Objectives
This project is an automated tool for scanning networks, identifying vulnerabilities, and generating detailed reports. The tool leverages the `nmap` library to perform comprehensive scans and includes email notification functionality to alert administrators about vulnerabilities detected in the network.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
1. **Python**: Ensure most up to date Python is installed on your system. 
2. **Nmap Library**: Install the Python `nmap` library for network scanning.
3. **SMTP Access**: Access to an SMTP server to enable email notifications.

### Installation Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/network-vulnerability-scanner.git
   ```
   Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd network-vulnerability-scanner
   ```

2. Install the required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install python-nmap
   ```

3. Modify the configuration in `network_vulnerability_scanner.py`:
   - **TARGETS**: List the IP addresses or ranges to scan.
   - **EMAIL_SENDER, EMAIL_RECEIVER, SMTP_SERVER**: Set up email credentials and server details.

## Usage

1. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python network_vulnerability_scanner.py
   ```

2. Customize configurations:
   - Edit the `TARGETS` list in the script to include specific IP addresses or networks.
   - Update the `PORT_RANGE` variable to limit the scan to specific ports.

3. Review scan reports:
   - Scan results will be saved in the `./scan_reports` directory as JSON files.
